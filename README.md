# React Native MineSweeper

Here's an example of my React Native coding 

It follows a typical architecture the index.js file in the entry point
that file loads the src/app.js file

The app.js file has the navigator stack

The components file has the Button and Squares components

run "npm install" or "yarn install" to load the dependencies - node_modules were not pushed to this repository

Instructions for installing react-navigation:

Install the react-navigation package in your React Native project.

yarn add react-navigation
# or with npm
# npm install --save react-navigation
Next, install react-native-gesture-handler. If you’re using Expo you don’t need to do anything here, it’s included in the SDK. Otherwise:

yarn add react-native-gesture-handler
# or with npm
# npm install --save react-native-gesture-handler
Link all native dependencies:

react-native link react-native-gesture-handler
